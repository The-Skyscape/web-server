      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The internet was supposed to be a place where anyone could build something incredible and share it with the world.
          A place where ideas flowed freely, where creativity was visible, and where technology empowered people instead of enclosing them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          But the modern landscape has drifted from that promise.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Platforms isolate creators into silos.
          Inspiration is buried beneath feeds designed for advertising, not imagination.
          Tools are paywalled, fragmented, and built for corporate control rather than personal expression.
          Innovation has a toll booth on every corner.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">
          We believe the future deserves better. So we are building Skyscape.
        </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">1. Ideas Should Be Free — Both Meanings of the Word</h2>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white/90">Free as in zero cost:</strong>
          Anyone should be able to share ideas, write code, deploy applications, and participate in a creative community without needing a credit card.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white/90">Free as in libre:</strong>
          The systems that govern creativity should be open, modifiable, forkable, and transparent.
          No secrets. No lock-in. No gated innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          A platform that isn't open cannot be trusted.
          A platform that isn't free cannot grow with dignity.
          A platform that isn't shared cannot inspire the world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          We reject the scarcity mindset. Creativity is abundant — it expands when shared.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">2. Visibility Drives Creativity</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-xl leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          When developers see each other building, they build more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Momentum is contagious.
          Inspiration compounds.
          One person's idea becomes another person's starting point.
          A single deployed app can spark ten new ones.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Community is not decoration; it is the engine of innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Skyscape exists to make creativity visible — to turn every idea, every repo, every application into a signal that others can learn from, build upon, and celebrate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          We are not a platform for consumption. We are a platform for creation.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">3. Tools Should Empower, Not Extract</h2>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The existing developer ecosystem is fragmented:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>GitHub stores your code but doesn't help it spread.</li>
          <li>LinkedIn stores your résumé but not your creativity.</li>
          <li>Vercel deploys your app but doesn't connect it to people.</li>
          <li>Product Hunt shows what's new but doesn't help you build it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Each platform solves one problem and then builds walls around everything else.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-xl leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          Skyscape breaks those walls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Idea → code → deploy → discover → iterate. All in one continuous flow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          No paywalls. No friction. No separation between thinking, building, and sharing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          Tools should serve the creator — not the other way around.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">4. The Cloud Should Be Positive-Sum</h2>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We reject the zero-sum assumption that one developer's success diminishes another's.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Skyscape is designed as a positive-sum ecosystem:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Every app deployed enriches the community</li>
          <li>Every idea shared expands the network</li>
          <li>Every success story inspires more creation</li>
          <li>Every upgrade subsidizes more free experimentation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Value flows outward, not upward.
          Growth is collective, not extracted.
          The platform succeeds only when developers succeed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          This is how the cloud should work.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">5. Simplicity Is Power</h2>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our architecture reflects our philosophy: straightforward, readable, self-contained systems.
          We believe complexity is often a tax masquerading as sophistication.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The internet grew fastest when it was simple.
          We intend to return to that spirit — powerful primitives that are easy to understand, remix, and build on.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <div class="card bg-base-100/80 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/5">
      <div class="card-body space-y-4">
        <h2 class="card-title text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90">6. Openness Is a Responsibility</h2>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We choose to be open-source because innovation deserves daylight.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When the platform is open:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Developers can learn from its design</li>
          <li>Contributors can shape its direction</li>
          <li>Communities can fork and extend it</li>
          <li>Trust is earned, not demanded</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The cloud should not be a black box. It should be a commons.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          Skyscape is open not because it is trendy — but because openness is the only way to build a platform worthy of the builders who use it.

        </p>
        <ul class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>The developer who stays up late experimenting</li>

          <li>The solo hacker who dreams in code</li>
          <li>The future founder who hasn't realized it yet</li>

          Skyscape is the place where they meet, create, share, and inspire each other — not behind corporate gates, but in the open air.
