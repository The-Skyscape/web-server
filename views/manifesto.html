        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          For too long, the platforms that developers depend on have been closed, proprietary systems.
          Heroku, Vercel, and others build incredible tools—but keep the code behind locked doors.
          We're doing things differently.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white/90">The Skyscape is open source.</strong> Not just our libraries or SDKs, but the actual
          platform that powers your code, your repositories, and your deployments. We're licensed under
          AGPL-3.0, which means any fork of our platform must remain open too.

        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          GitHub is excellent for code, but it's missing something essential: <em>community</em>.
          Where are the conversations? The connections? The ability to discover what other developers
          are building and thinking?
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          LinkedIn exists, but it's designed for recruiters and job seekers—not for developers who
          want to share ideas, collaborate, and build together.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white/90">The Skyscape bridges this gap.</strong> We combine the code hosting you need with
          the social features you deserve. Share your work, follow developers you admire, discuss ideas,
          and build your professional presence—all in one place.

        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Every repository on The Skyscape is source-available. We encourage you to license your code
          however you choose—MIT, Apache, GPL, AGPL, or even proprietary—but we believe in transparency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Code should be viewable. Ideas should be shareable. When you host on The Skyscape, others
          can learn from your work, fork your projects, and contribute back. That's how great software
          gets built.

        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The major platforms have gotten comfortable. They take your code, your data, and your network
          effects—and give you a service in return. But the relationship is imbalanced.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white/90">We're building something different.</strong> The Skyscape isn't just a service—it's
          infrastructure you can trust, inspect, and even run yourself if you want. We're AGPL because
          we want this platform to belong to the community, not to shareholders.

        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This platform is built by developers, for developers. No marketing fluff. No enterprise
          sales teams dictating features. No venture capitalists demanding growth at all costs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Just a simple idea: what if the tools we use every day were built in the open, designed
          for our needs, and owned by the community?

          The Skyscape isn't finished. It's evolving. We're building better discovery tools,
          improving collaboration features, and making it easier to share your work with the community.

        <p class="text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          But here's the thing: <strong class="text-white/90">you can help.</strong> Our platform is open source. You can
          contribute by creating repositories, sharing your projects, opening issues, and submitting pull requests.
          This is your platform as much as it is ours.
